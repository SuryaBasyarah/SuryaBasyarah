- Average computer science student
- I have a strong interest in C++ and game development, and I'm still learning Flutter.
- I prefer working as a back-end engineer rather than in front-end development, and i'm not into UI/UX design.
- Unrelated but worth mentioning: I am a PC enthusiast with good knowledge about troubleshooting.
